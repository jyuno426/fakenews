Employees at the social network were training chatbots to communicate like humans when they suddenly went astray. 1 Employees were forced to reign in the chatbots when they created their own language to communicate more effectivelyCredit: EPA It follows warnings that scientists have successfully trained computers to use artificial intelligence to learn from experience – and one day they could be smarter than their creators. You might be familiar with chatbots in Facebook Messenger or as virtual sales assistants found on a number of online shops. Theyve been relatively unsophisticated until now - repeating back a set script dependant on what you type into their chatboxes.

To do this effectively, the super-smart software realised it would be more effective to write and use their own language - which is completely incomprehensible to humans. In a blogpost, the Facebook researchers wrote: To date, existing work on chatbots has led to systems that can hold short conversations and perform simple tasks such as booking a restaurant. But building machines that can hold meaningful conversations with people is challenging because it requires a bot to combine its understanding of the conversation with its knowledge of the world, and then produce a new sentence that helps it achieve its goals. To do this, the researchers practised thousands of different negotiations against itself, like can I have the hat and you can have the hat if you give me two basketballs. But it had to make sure it stuck to human-like language. How do computers think?Scientists have been training computers how to learn, like humans, since the 1970s. But recent advances in data storage mean that the process has sped up exponentially in recent years. Interest in the field hit a peak when Google paid hundreds of millions to buy a British deep learning company in 2015. Coined machine learning or a neural network, deep learning is effectively training a computer so it can figure out natural language and instructions. Its fed information and is then quizzed on it, so it can learn, similarly to a child in the early years at at school. Thats because the researchers found that updating the parameters of both agents led to divergence from human language as the agents developed their own language for negotiating, they added. Experts have previously warned that humanity is already losing control of artificial intelligence and it could spell disaster for our species. One of the worlds smartest men, Professor Stephen Hawking has also warned that super-smart software will spell the end of our species. The world-renowned scientist hinted at a potential apocalyptic nightmare scenario similar to those played out popular sci-fi films like Terminator and The Matrix – where robots rule over humans. Hes claimed that we must leave planet Earth within 100 years - or face extinction as machines rise up and overtake us in the evolutionary race. We pay for your stories!
