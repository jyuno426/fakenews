A portion of this plastic travels to ocean garbage patches, getting caught in a vortex of circulating currents. If no action is taken, the plastic will increasingly impact our ecosystems, health, and economies. Illustration of The Ocean Cleanup cleanup process We develop advanced technologies to rid the oceans of plastic Solving it requires a combination of closing the source and cleaning up what has already accumulated in the ocean and doesnât go away by itself. Cleaning the ocean The Ocean Cleanup is developing a passive cleanup method, which uses the natural oceanic forces to rapidly and cost-effectively clean up the plastic already in the oceans. With a full fleet of cleanup systems in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, we aim to clean up 50% of its plastic every five years.

By placing Interceptors in 1000 strategic locations in rivers around the world, we aim to halt 80% of plastic from entering the oceans in five yearsâ time.
