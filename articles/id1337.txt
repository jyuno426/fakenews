Japan has extended its sincere apologies and remorse to former comfort women on many occasions.Although all issues of property and claims between Japan and South Korea, including the issue of the comfort women, were legally settled, Japan has made an effort to recover the honor and dignity and heal the psychological wounds of all former comfort women. In 1995, Japan established the Asian Women’s Fund, to which the government made a contribution of about $46 million in total. The fund handed atonement money to former comfort women, including those in South Korea, and successive Japanese prime ministers sent letters of apology directly to each woman.Furthermore, Japan and South Korea reached agreement in 2015 on the final and irreversible resolution of the issue. Japan provided about $9.7 million to the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation established by South Korea to provide support for the former comfort women. Thirty-four of the 47 surviving women received support from the fund and welcomed the effort.This is an undeniable fact.Takeshi OsugaTokyoThe writer is press secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
